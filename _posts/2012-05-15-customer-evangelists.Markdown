My Fitbit recently just stopped working. As far as I know, I hadn't done anything to damage the device, but it would not hold a charge. After searching [Fitbit.com](http://fitbit.com)'s support pages, I went through the recommended steps. No dice. So I emailed support.

I was expecting to be told that I'd have to send in the Fitbit before anything could be done or even that I was out of luck. Instead within 24 hours I was told to toss the broken device and that they sent me a replacement. I was already a [huge fan of  Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com/user/22C25R); I mean I'm closing in on 5 million steps. But I'd never contacted support and did not know what to expect. After this experience, my loyalty to Fitbit was increased tenfold. Instead of just sending me a canned response, the representative read my email, troubleshot my issue, and solved the problem. No hassle. No extra work for me. Thank you Fitbit.

###This is being a Customer Evangelist.

Companies that want to build loyalty should strive to be Customer Evangelists. The most frequent reason customers contact companies is to seek support. Make it painless; make it easy; treat us fairly. Customer support is a make or break event. I'm already running into problems, and don't want a form letter sent back to me. I want personalized, authentic help. If your support system is not up to the task, customers will not stick around.

Before this experience I'm not sure if I would have bought another Fitbit. Now that I know Fitbit will treat me fairly, I know I will. Hell, I already know what some people will be getting for gifts this year. Be good to your customers and they'll be good to you.
