Its almost 2015 and perhaps you are stuck in a Twitter rut, so why not find a few new people to follow? I regularly try to add some new voices to my feed to keep things fresh. I also think this helps to keep my world from getting too homogeneous. I mean who likes to see the same article, quote, or retweet fill their feed?

[Twitter's](http://twitter.com) "Discover Tab" and "Who To Follow" functions work well enough, although in my experience their algorithm heavily weighs people you already follow or with whom you interact. We're trying to get out of the echo chamber. You can search some new topics on Twitter looking for some variety, but instead I'll help out by highlighting a few different people I think add some variety to my feed. 

First up, Chris Jaffe, a good follow for those who want to add some baseball or history to their feed. I enjoy Chris's daily tweets such as this one:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Today, King Carlos I of (who recently stepped down) is exactly as old as Louis XIV of France was the day he died: 28,119. They&#39;re related.</p>&mdash; Chris Jaffe (@jaffechris) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffechris/status/550300748912001024">December 31, 2014</a></blockquote>

Second, Zvi Band, founder of [@Contactually](http://twitter.com/contactually). If you are interested in startups, leadership, or Washington, DC, give him a look.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Being A Leader Sometimes Means Finding The Willingness And Courage To Be Led <a href="http://t.co/o4tqeWRBqc">http://t.co/o4tqeWRBqc</a></p>&mdash; Zvi Band (@skeevis) <a href="https://twitter.com/skeevis/status/550335848290725888">December 31, 2014</a></blockquote>

Third, how about some science? NASA does a great job of posting interesting articles and photos. They get to go to space; why not follow along?
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Waiting for the ball to drop? Enjoy this cluster of sparkle from <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA_Hubble">@NASA_Hubble</a>: <a href="http://t.co/TICDkkek5U">http://t.co/TICDkkek5U</a> <a href="http://t.co/F3Uofri36u">pic.twitter.com/F3Uofri36u</a></p>&mdash; NASA (@NASA) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/550335374002630657">December 31, 2014</a></blockquote>

Fourth, a personal favorite because I love the outdoors. The Department of the Interior consistently adds locations to visit to my bucket list with their great photos of the United State's National Parks.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Spectacular <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sunrise?src=hash">#sunrise</a> over <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Colorado?src=hash">#Colorado</a> National Monument by William Woodward. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nature?src=hash">#nature</a> <a href="http://t.co/swtOyHyK2p">pic.twitter.com/swtOyHyK2p</a></p>&mdash; US Dept of Interior (@Interior) <a href="https://twitter.com/Interior/status/548996784388059136">December 28, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Fifth, want to run a marathon? Want to run one in every state? Just want to follow along as someone else does? Here you go:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>August 3, 2014 - where do I go from here…? - Just posting to talk about some of the background and... <a href="http://t.co/wnpX72wx88">http://t.co/wnpX72wx88</a></p>&mdash; Run 2 Learn (@run2learn) <a href="https://twitter.com/run2learn/status/496095933617434626">August 4, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Finally, Chris Guillebeau, author of [several books](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3367145.Chris_Guillebeau) and world traveler:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>What do you think about the business theory of “don’t put all your eggs in one basket?” Good / bad / something else?</p>&mdash; Chris Guillebeau (@chrisguillebeau) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisguillebeau/status/549990502993362948">December 30, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As always, I'm looking to add some new people to follow, so if you have any suggestions I'd love to hear about them.
