### The Iron Yard Minneapolis Spring 2016

The last time I seriously drafted an article on this site was well over a year ago. This strikes me as sad. That said, I'm planning on updating more often for the foreseeable future. A small hurdle, but you have to start somewhere.

I've thought for years about joining a coding boot camp. The subject has interested since middle school, but I never really pursued it seriously. And thus after college and law school I waffled for years about applying to several of the options in DC and elsewhere. Now that I've moved closer to home and live in Minneapolis, I finally took the plunge and applied to the New Iron Yard campus here in Minneapolis. I obtained a spot, and I decided now was the time. We're on day two at the moment and it has been great so far.
